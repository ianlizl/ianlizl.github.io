Hi! I’m Ian. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong.

My research focuses on environmental policy and public administration, with particular interests in environmental attitudes and public opinion, environmental inequality, regulation, information disclosure, and citizen-state interactions. My work has been published in Public Administration Review, Public Management Review, Political Behavior, and other leading journals.

Before joining HKU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Ross School of Business and the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. I earned my Ph.D. in Public Affairs from the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, my Master of Public Administration from the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, and my Bachelor’s degree from Renmin University of China.
